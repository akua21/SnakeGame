# SnakeGame
It's a version of the classic Snake Game made for learning *Pygame*

The game is controlled with the keyboad arrows and the rules are the same as the original game

There are different maps in the folder *maps*

There are also a few **arguments** that you can use:

- ``` "-h", "--help" ``` , Help guide
- ``` "-l", "--layout" ``` , The name of the map (*default: square*) 
- ``` "-t", "--time" ``` , The speed (*default: 0.1*)
